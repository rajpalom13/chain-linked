# The Anti-AI Writing Guide

How to write content that doesn't sound like it came from AI.

---

## The Core Principle

No single word or phrase proves AI wrote something. **It's the pattern cluster** that gives it away: templated hook → generic setup → neat list → smooth transitions → tidy conclusion → soft CTA. Human writing has texture, friction, and specificity. AI writing is frictionless and vague.

## Part 1: Words to Retire

### The Instant Red Flags

These words have been so overused by LLMs that they now function as AI fingerprints.

| Kill This | Use Instead |
| :---- | :---- |
| Delve | dig into, look at, break down |
| Tapestry | mix, combination, mess |
| Landscape | market, space, category |
| Robust | reliable, holds up, solid |
| Seamless | simple, easy, one-step |
| Leverage | use, apply, pull |
| Unlock | get, enable, allow |
| Elevate | improve, raise |
| Foster | build, create, encourage |
| Navigate | handle, deal with, work through |
| Comprehensive | full, complete, end-to-end |
| Pivotal | important, key |
| Nuanced | (just delete it) |
| Multifaceted | complex, layered |
| Harness | use, capture |
| Embark | start, begin |
| Spearhead | lead, run |
| Catalyst | cause, trigger |
| Synergy | (delete entirely) |
| Paradigm | model, approach |
| Testament | proof, sign, evidence |
| Realm | area, space |
| Myriad | many, a lot of |
| Underscore | show, highlight |
| Streamline | simplify, cut steps |
| Showcase | show, demonstrate |

### The Corporate Hype Words

These make any sentence sound like a press release written by committee.

- Game-changing / Game-changer  
- Cutting-edge  
- Groundbreaking  
- Revolutionary  
- Innovative  
- Transformative  
- Next-level  
- Best-in-class / World-class  
- State-of-the-art

**Fix:** Replace with what actually happened. "This reduced rework by 30%" beats "This was a game-changing improvement."

## Part 2: Phrases to Stop Using

### Scene-Setter Openers (Delete These)

These phrases add nothing. They're filler before the actual point.

- "Here's the thing..."  
- "Here's the truth..."  
- "But here's the kicker..."  
- "Let's unpack this."  
- "Let's dive in."  
- "Let that sink in."  
- "Read that again."  
- "Buckle up."  
- "It is important to note that..."  
- "It's worth noting that..."  
- "In today's fast-paced world..."  
- "In the ever-evolving landscape of..."  
- "In this article, we will..."

**Fix:** Start with the actual point. Or start in the middle of a specific moment.

### Faux-Depth Phrases (Sound Smart, Say Nothing)

- "At its core..."  
- "At the end of the day..."  
- "The bottom line is..."  
- "When it comes to..."  
- "It goes without saying..."  
- "It cannot be overstated..."  
- "This is not just about X, it's about Y."  
- "More than just a..."  
- "What sets X apart is..."  
- "This begs the question..."

### Transition Crutches

AI uses these to fake logical flow without doing actual argumentative work.

- "Furthermore..."  
- "Moreover..."  
- "Additionally..."  
- "Indeed..."  
- "That said..."  
- "That being said..."  
- "With that in mind..."  
- "It's also worth mentioning..."  
- "On a related note..."  
- "Interestingly enough..."  
- "Crucially..."  
- "Excitingly..."

**Fix:** Cut them. Or use simpler connectors: "And," "But," "So," "Also."

### The Hedging Pattern

AI is terrified of being wrong, so it constantly qualifies.

- "It is important to note that..."  
- "However, it is crucial to remember..."  
- "While X is true, we must not overlook Y..."  
- "It depends..."  
- "There are pros and cons..."  
- "Generally speaking..."  
- "It's worth considering..."

**Fix:** Take a position. Say what you actually think. Add the exception as a secondary point, not a disclaimer.

### The Assistant Voice

These phrases reveal the "helpful AI" mode.

- "Hope this helps\!"  
- "Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate."  
- "I'd be happy to..."  
- "Great question\!"  
- "That's an excellent point\!"  
- "Absolutely\!"

**Fix:** End with a specific action or your actual opinion. Don't close like a customer service bot.

## Part 3: Structural Patterns to Break

### The "Perfectly Packaged Mini-Essay"

**AI pattern:**

1. Hook that sounds universally true  
2. 3-7 bullet "framework"  
3. Smooth summary  
4. CTA ("Comment X to get the template")

**Human fix:**

- Start in the middle of something real (a moment, mistake, decision)  
- Include one messy part: what didn't work, what surprised you  
- Replace the tidy summary with a specific action you took

### The LinkedIn Formula

**AI pattern:**

- Generic one-liner opener  
- Short narrative  
- Bold "lesson"  
- Engagement bait closer

**Human fix:**

- Replace generic hooks with time/place/trigger: "On a call Tuesday..." or "In a HubSpot portal with 8 pipelines..."  
- Replace "playbook" bullets with one decision \+ why \+ one constraint

**Note:** Punchy, direct openers are NOT AI-isms. Lines like "AI Adoption \= Ego Death" are strong hooks. They're specific, opinionated, and create tension. The problem is *generic* dramatic openers that could apply to anything.

### The Symmetrical Structure

**AI pattern:**

- Every paragraph is the same length  
- Every sentence is medium-length  
- Everything flows too smoothly

**Human fix:**

- Mix sentence length: 5-8 word punches \+ 20-30 word explanations  
- Add one fragment occasionally  
- Allow a slight topic pivot that reflects how you actually think

### The "Not X, But Y" Construction

AI uses this constantly to sound profound:

- "It's not just about coding; it's about problem-solving."  
- "Marketing isn't about selling; it's about storytelling."

**Fix:** State what it IS about, directly. Skip the rhetorical contrast.

### The Binary Balance

AI loves to end with "finding the middle ground" because it's safe:

- "It's about striking a balance between X and Y."  
- "It's a double-edged sword."  
- "A harmonious blend of..."  
- "The intersection of art and science."

**Fix:** Pick a side. Or name the actual tradeoff with specifics.

## Part 4: Formatting Tells

### Punctuation

- **Em dashes:** Banned entirely. Use commas, periods, or parentheses instead. This is the single most-cited AI tell.  
- **Excessive bolding** for "emphasis"  
- **Colons before every list:** "Here's the thing:" / "Here's the playbook:" (feels templated when repeated)  
- **Smart/curly quotation marks** in contexts where straight quotes are standard

### Visual Structure

- Numbered lists where paragraphs would work  
- Headers on everything, even short responses  
- The "Rule of Three" in every grouping  
- Emoji bookends on LinkedIn  
- One-sentence paragraphs stacked for fake drama (when content doesn't warrant it)

---

## Part 5: LinkedIn-Specific Patterns

### Humble Brag Openers

- "I'm thrilled/humbled to announce..."  
- "Never thought I'd be sharing this..."  
- "So this happened today..."  
- "Full circle moment."

### Hot Take Intros (with bland takes)

- "Unpopular opinion:" (followed by bland take)  
- "No one is talking about this enough."  
- "This might upset some people..."  
- "Not sure who needs to hear this, but..."

### Recycled Wisdom

- "Leadership is not a title."  
- "Your network is your net worth."  
- "Culture eats strategy for breakfast."  
- "Done is better than perfect."  
- "People don't leave companies; they leave managers."  
- "Soft skills are the new hard skills."

### Engagement Bait Closers

- "What do you think? Drop a comment below."  
- "Agree or disagree?"  
- "Tag someone who needs to hear this."  
- "Thoughts?"

### Template Posts to Retire

- "I used to think X. Then I learned Y."  
- "Here's the playbook:" → 7 bullets → CTA  
- "Stop doing X. Start doing Y."

## Part 6: How to Sound Human

### Add Specifics AI Rarely Invents

- A number with context: "12 deals," "3 reps," "42%," "2-week cycle"  
- A named constraint: "small team," "no ops headcount," "messy CRM"  
- A "why this matters" tied to cost: time, money, reputation, churn

### Include Tradeoffs and Edges

AI avoids being wrong. Humans acknowledge limits.

- "This works until..."  
- "I don't think this applies if..."  
- "If you do this, you'll pay the price in..."

### Add a Small Lived Detail

- "We tried to fix it with a workflow. It made it worse."  
- "We thought it was messaging. It was routing."  
- "The dashboard looked great. The pipeline was still dead."

### Take a Position

Polite neutrality feels AI-ish.

- "I'm bearish on X because..."  
- "This is overrated unless..."  
- "Most teams are solving the wrong problem here."

## Part 7: The Editing Checklist

Run this after drafting.

**Step 1: Strip scaffolding** Delete: "Let's..." openers, "In today's..." context, "It's important to note...", "In conclusion..."

**Step 2: Replace generic nouns**

- "businesses" → "mid-market SaaS with 5-15 sellers"  
- "customers" → "CFO buyers" / "RevOps leaders"  
- "results" → "fewer no-shows" / "shorter cycle time"

**Step 3: Add two proof anchors** Pick any two: a number, a concrete example, a counterexample, a constraint

**Step 4: Break the rhythm**

- Combine two short lines into one longer thought  
- Turn one long sentence into two punchy ones

**Step 5: Kill the assistant close** End with: a specific action you took, or a question you genuinely want answered (not bait)

## Part 8: Prompt Constraints for AI-Assisted Drafting

Paste this into your prompt when using AI to draft:

```
BANNED PHRASES:
- "Here's the thing" / "Here's the truth" / "Here's the kicker"
- "Let's unpack this" / "Let's dive in"
- "It's important to note"
- "In today's fast-paced world"
- "At the end of the day"
- "Hope this helps"
- "Game-changing" / "revolutionary" / "groundbreaking"
- "Delve" / "tapestry" / "landscape" / "robust" / "seamless" / "unlock" / "elevate"
- "Furthermore" / "Moreover" / "Additionally"

STYLE RULES:
- No em dashes
- No more than 1 colon per 150 words
- Use at least 2 concrete details (numbers, tools, roles, constraints)
- Include 1 tradeoff or exception case
- Never start a sentence with "Here is" or "Here's"
- Write like you talk: some short lines, some longer
- Take positions, don't hedge
```

## The Quick Test

**Human:** "The project was a mess of different ideas." **AI:** "The project was a rich tapestry of diverse perspectives."

**Human:** "We need to look closer at the data." **AI:** "We must delve deeper into the data to unlock actionable insights."

If your sentence sounds like the second version, rewrite it.

## What's NOT an AI-ism

Some things get flagged as "AI" that are actually just strong writing:

- **Bold, direct openers** ("AI Adoption \= Ego Death") \- These are good. They're specific and opinionated.  
- **Short sentences for emphasis** \- Fine when used intentionally, not as a crutch.  
- **Lists** \- Not inherently AI. Just don't default to 3-7 bullets for everything.

The difference: AI patterns are *generic* and *repetitive*. Human patterns are *intentional* and *specific*.
