## 1. Dashboard

### Description

The Dashboard is the main landing page after login. It provides a high-level overview of the user's LinkedIn activity, upcoming scheduled content, recent posts, and a getting-started checklist for new users. The layout is designed for quick orientation and fast navigation into deeper features.

### Key Capabilities

- **Getting Started Checklist** -- A progress-tracked onboarding widget shown to new users. Steps include connecting LinkedIn, installing the Chrome extension, creating a first post, and scheduling content. Users can dismiss it once all steps are complete or at any time.
- **Quick Stat Metric Cards** -- Four animated cards displaying key LinkedIn metrics (impressions, followers, reactions, engagement rate) with percentage change compared to the previous period. Each card is color-coded by accent theme and uses animated number transitions.
- **Schedule Calendar** -- A full-size interactive calendar displaying all scheduled posts as color-coded indicators. Clicking a date with no posts navigates to the compose page pre-filled with that date. Clicking a date with one post opens it for editing. Clicking a date with multiple posts opens a picker dialog.
- **Upcoming Scheduled Posts** -- A panel showing the next batch of scheduled posts with content previews, scheduled times, and quick edit/delete actions.
- **My Recent Posts** -- A section listing the user's most recently published LinkedIn posts with engagement metrics (impressions, reactions, comments, reposts).
- **Extension Install Prompt** -- A contextual banner prompting users to install the ChainLinked Chrome extension if it is not detected.

### User Workflow

1. User logs in and lands on the Dashboard.
2. New users see the Getting Started checklist and follow the steps.
3. Metric cards provide an at-a-glance view of recent LinkedIn performance.
4. The calendar shows upcoming content at a glance; clicking a date opens compose or edit flows.
5. Recent posts allow quick review of published content and its performance.

### Key Capabilities

- **Two Compose Tabs** -- "Single Post" for individual posts and "Post Series" for creating a sequence of related posts.
- **Rich Text Editor** -- A full-featured text editor with formatting toolbar supporting bold, italic, lists, and Unicode font styles. Character count uses Unicode code-point counting for accuracy with emoji and special characters.
- **AI Chat-Based Generation** -- An inline AI panel (chat interface) that generates post content based on user-provided topics, tone, context, and post type. The conversation is persisted across sessions.
- **Tone Selector** -- Choose the tone of AI-generated content (professional, casual, inspirational, humorous, etc.).
- **Post Types** -- Select the type of post (thought leadership, how-to, story, list, question, etc.) to guide AI generation.
- **Character Limit Indicator** -- Real-time character count with visual indicator against LinkedIn's 3,000-character limit. Uses code-point-based counting to handle emoji correctly.
- **Emoji Picker** -- Integrated emoji selection interface for inserting emoji into post content.

- **Font Picker** -- Apply Unicode font styles (serif, sans-serif, monospace, script, etc.) to selected text for visual variety within LinkedIn's plain-text format.
- **Scheduling** -- Schedule a post for a future date and time with timezone support. The schedule modal allows picking date, time, and timezone, with proper UTC conversion.
- **Post to LinkedIn** -- Directly publish content to LinkedIn via the API with image support.
- **Edit Scheduled Posts** -- Open an existing scheduled post for editing, with the ability to reschedule or save changes without re-picking the time.
- **Auto-Save Drafts** -- Content is automatically saved as a draft every 30 seconds, on page navigation, and on browser close (via `navigator.sendBeacon`). Draft status is shown with a saving/saved indicator.
- **Remix from My Posts** -- A collapsible section showing the user's 10 most recent posts with a "Remix" button that feeds the content into AI for generating a fresh version.
- **Compose Mode** -- The composer supports both basic and advanced modes, toggling the visibility of AI features and additional controls.

## Architecture Notes

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 with App Router |
| UI Library | React 19 |
| Components | shadcn/ui (new-york style) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS variables |
| Charts | Recharts |
| Animations | Framer Motion |
| Canvas | Konva.js (carousel editor) |
| Database | Supabase PostgreSQL |
| Auth | Supabase Auth (email/password, Google OAuth) |
| Icons | Tabler Icons + Lucide React |
| State | React hooks (useState, useContext, useRef) |
| Form Validation | Zod |
| Tables | TanStack React Table |

### Key Design Patterns

- **Server Components by default** -- Pages use `"use client"` directive only when interactivity is needed.
- **Custom hooks for data** -- Each feature has dedicated hooks (e.g., `use-analytics-v2`, `use-team-posts`) that encapsulate data fetching, caching, and error handling.
- **Context providers** -- Auth state (`AuthProvider`), draft state (`DraftContext`), and dashboard metadata (`DashboardContext`) are managed via React Context.
- **Auto-save with sendBeacon** -- The compose page uses `navigator.sendBeacon` for reliable draft saving on page close and `fetch` for periodic saves.
- **Framer Motion animations** -- Stagger containers, fade/slide variants, and spring-based transitions are used throughout for polished UI interactions.
- **Error boundaries** -- Feature sections are wrapped in error boundaries to prevent cascading failures.
- **Skeleton loading** -- Every page has a dedicated skeleton component for smooth loading states.
- **Toast notifications** -- Sonner-based toast system with feature-specific helpers (swipeToast, postToast, inspirationToast).
