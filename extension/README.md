# LinkedIn Data Extractor

A Chrome extension for extracting your LinkedIn profile data, analytics, and network insights. Built with Manifest V3.

- **DOM Extraction**: Falls back to DOM scraping when API data isn't available
- **Local Storage**: All data stays on your machine - no external servers
- **Export Functionality**: Export your data as JSON or CSV
- **Privacy-Focused**: You control what data is captured and stored

## Installation

### From Source (Developer Mode)

1. **Generate Icons** (if using placeholders):
   - Open `icons/generate-icons.html` in your browser
   - Click "Download All Icons"
   - Move downloaded files to the `icons/` folder

2. **Load Extension**:
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `extension` folder

3. **Navigate to LinkedIn**:
   - Go to `https://www.linkedin.com`
   - Log in to your account
   - Click the extension icon in your toolbar

## Usage

### Automatic Capture
When you browse LinkedIn analytics pages, the extension automatically captures:
- **Creator Analytics**: Impressions, members reached, top posts
- **Post Analytics**: Individual post performance metrics
- **Audience Analytics**: Follower counts and demographics
- **Profile Views**: Who viewed your profile

The auto-capture system:
- Detects navigation to analytics pages (SPA-aware)
- Debounces captures to prevent duplicates (5-minute cache)
- Tracks capture history with 90-day retention
- Shows growth indicators comparing current vs previous data

### Auto-Capture Status
- View capture statistics in the Settings tab
- Toggle auto-capture on/off
- See last capture time
- View growth trends (impressions, followers)

### Manual Extraction
1. Click the extension icon
2. Click "Extract Now" to capture current page data
3. View captured data with "View Data" button

### Exporting Data
- **JSON Export**: Complete data export with all details
- **CSV Export**: Tabular format for spreadsheet analysis

## Data Captured

### Profile Data
- Name, headline, location
- Profile photo URL
- Connection count
- Follower count
- Member URN

### Analytics Data
- **Creator Analytics**: Impressions, members reached, engagement rate, top posts
- **Post Analytics**: Per-post impressions, reactions, comments, demographics
- **Audience Analytics**: Total followers, growth rate, demographics breakdown
- **Profile Views**: View count, viewer profiles, view trends
- **History Tracking**: 90-day trend data for growth calculations

### API Responses
All LinkedIn Voyager API responses are captured, including:
- `/voyager/api/identity/*` - Profile information
- `/voyager/api/relationships/*` - Connections and network
- `/voyager/api/analytics/*` - Analytics data
- `/voyager/api/feed/*` - Feed content

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Cookie Access**: The extension reads LinkedIn's authentication cookies (`li_at`, `JSESSIONID`) through Chrome's cookies API.

2. **Network Interception**: Content scripts monkey-patch `window.fetch()` and `XMLHttpRequest` to intercept all API calls to LinkedIn's Voyager API.

3. **DOM Extraction**: When API data isn't available, the extension scrapes data directly from LinkedIn's rendered DOM.

4. **Message Passing**: Data flows from content scripts → service worker → storage, with the popup UI querying the service worker for display.

### Key Differences from Taplio X

| Feature | Taplio X | This Extension |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| Data Storage | External servers | Local only |
| Auth Token Handling | Sent to backend | Stays local |
| Server Required | Yes | No |
| Privacy | Tokens shared | Full privacy |
| Export Options | Limited | JSON/CSV |

## Security Considerations

- **No External Servers**: All data stays on your local machine
- **No Token Transmission**: Authentication tokens are never sent externally
- **User Control**: You choose when to extract and what to export
- **Transparent**: All code is readable and auditable

## Permissions Explained

- `cookies`: Read LinkedIn authentication cookies
- `storage`: Store captured data locally
- `activeTab`: Access current tab for extraction
- `scripting`: Inject content scripts into LinkedIn pages
- `host_permissions` for `linkedin.com`: Required for content script injection

## Development

### Building
No build step required - the extension runs directly from source.

### Testing
1. Load the unpacked extension
2. Navigate to LinkedIn
3. Check the browser console for logs (filter by `[ContentScript]`, `[Interceptor]`, etc.)

### Debugging
- **Service Worker**: `chrome://extensions/` → Click "Inspect views: service worker"
- **Content Script**: DevTools on LinkedIn page → Console
- **Popup**: Right-click extension icon → "Inspect popup"

## Limitations

- Only works when logged into LinkedIn
- Some data requires visiting specific pages
- LinkedIn may change their API structure at any time
- Rate limits may apply to extensive data collection
