## Overview

ChainLinked is a full-stack SaaS platform that helps teams create, schedule, analyze, and optimize their LinkedIn content from a single workspace. It combines AI-powered writing assistance, deep research pipelines, a visual carousel creator, and real-time analytics into a unified dashboard designed for marketing teams, founders, and content creators.

The platform goes beyond simple scheduling. ChainLinked ingests trending content and news articles daily, lets users remix viral posts into their own voice, tracks influencer activity, and surfaces personalized post suggestions through a Tinder-style swipe interface. Every team member's performance is tracked with granular analytics that roll up from daily deltas into weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly aggregates.

ChainLinked also includes a companion Chrome extension that captures LinkedIn data directly from the browser -- profile analytics, post performance metrics, audience demographics, and connection data. The extension syncs this information to Supabase in real time, powering the analytics dashboards and feeding the AI generation pipeline with context about each user's audience.

### Post Quality Pipeline
- **Content rules verification** -- a second LLM pass checks every generated post against user-configured and team-level content rules, reporting violations with severity and fix suggestions
- **Fact-checking** -- extracts verifiable claims from the post, searches each claim via Tavily, then assesses accuracy with source-backed verdicts (supported / refuted / unverifiable)
- **Auto-refinement** -- if the verification or fact-check steps find errors, the pipeline surgically fixes only the flagged issues while preserving the author's voice and style
- Pipeline runs automatically on every generation (opt-out via `runPipeline: false`) and is also available as a standalone `POST /api/ai/pipeline` endpoint
- Pipeline status UI component shows step-by-step progress, timing, and issue details

### ChatGPT OAuth Connection

- Manual API key entry as a fallback
- Connection status, email, and plan type displayed in Settings
- Token refresh support and secure storage in Supabase with RLS
- One-click disconnect

### Prompt Management

## Database

ChainLinked uses **Supabase PostgreSQL** with **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables. The schema is managed through SQL migration files in `supabase/migrations/`.

Key table groups:

- **Users and Auth** -- `users`, `linkedin_profiles`, `linkedin_tokens`, `user_api_keys`
- **Teams** -- team membership, invitations, join requests, role-based access
- **Content** -- `scheduled_posts`, `drafts`, `my_posts`, `post_analytics`
- **Analytics** -- `daily_account_snapshots`, `daily_post_snapshots`, `post_analytics_daily`, `post_analytics_accumulative`, `profile_analytics_daily`, `profile_analytics_accumulative`, `analytics_summary_cache`, `linkedin_analytics`, `analytics_history`
- **Discovery** -- `discover_posts`, `feed_posts`, `wishlist_collections`
- **AI and Research** -- `company_context`, `research_tables`, `swipe_suggestions`, `prompt_system`, `content_rules`
- **OAuth** -- `openai_connections` (ChatGPT OAuth tokens and manual API keys), `openai_device_sessions` (temporary device code sessions)
- **Templates** -- `carousel_templates`, post templates
- **Extension** -- `captured_apis`, `capture_stats`, `extension_settings`, `sync_metadata`, `connections`, `comments`, `followers`

All database access uses typed Supabase clients (server-side for Server Components, browser-side for client mutations) with generated TypeScript types in `types/database.ts`.

Register the Inngest serve endpoint at `/api/inngest` in your Inngest dashboard. All workflow functions will be automatically discovered and registered.

### Chrome Extension

The Chrome extension lives in the `extension/` directory with its own build tooling (Vite + esbuild). Build it separately:

```bash
cd extension
npm install
npm run build
```

The built extension can be loaded as an unpacked extension in Chrome or published to the Chrome Web Store.
